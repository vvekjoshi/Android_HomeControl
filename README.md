# Android_HomeControl
This android repository uses MQTT (IoT protocol) client for communication to a broker server. It implements basic functionlity for home appliances control which could be used for bigger Home automation applications.
The functionality includes:-
1. Setting up client with username and password.
2. Publishing message to broker server.
3. Subscribing to broker server.
4. It uses two activities:-One being the controlling of aplliances and other is for updating the broker address.
5. App is also sync with the server. It automatically updates the switch states corresponding to the recieved messages.

I hope it helps you in starting in MQTT with android.
